## Overview


This project utilizes AWS Cloud Services to build an efficient ETL pipeline for processing YouTube video statistics data. The data, available [here](https://kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new), is downloaded from Kaggle and uploaded to an S3 bucket. AWS Glue catalogs the data, enabling seamless querying using Amazon Athena. The pipeline processes both JSON and CSV data, converting them into Parquet format. JSON data is transformed using AWS Lambda functions with AWS Data Wrangler layers, while CSV data is processed through visual ETL jobs in AWS Glue.

Data is first stored in a raw S3 bucket, then cleaned and organized in a cleansed bucket, and finally joined and stored in an analytics or materialized bucket. Automated ETL jobs run daily using AWS Glue workflows, ensuring up-to-date data processing. A simple QuickSight dashboard visualizes the cleansed data, providing valuable insights into YouTube video performance across different regions. This setup ensures a scalable and efficient data processing workflow, facilitating detailed analysis and reporting.
